# 🎉 Bot-Successes Repository  
Welcome to **Bot-Successes**, the curated home of my journey into automation, community engagement, and digital creativity — all built with zero budget, zero paid hosting, and purely using free services as of **2025-10-31**.

## 🚀 Why this repository exists  
When I first started, I built two flagship bots: a Telegram bot and a Mastodon bot.  
- The Telegram bot handles community engagement, notifications, fun interactions and utilities.  
- The Mastodon bot (“Sigmund-Bot”) analyses posts, offers curated thoughts, and bridges Fediverse communities.  
These two projects proved the concept: **bots can be meaningful, automated, resilient**, and most importantly — **free to maintain**.

But this is only the beginning. My vision is to **expand to other platforms**, other domains, and build more automations, integrations and community-friendly tools — keeping everything **cost-free** (or as close to free as possible).

## 🌍 Platforms & Use-Cases Where Bots Thrive  
Here are some of the many platforms and use-cases where bots can be created and bring value:

- Telegram — chat bots, utility bots, notifications, community helpers  
- Mastodon / Fediverse — fediverse automations, cross-posting, sentiment analytics  
- Discord — community moderators, fun “game” bots, music and media bots  
- Slack / Microsoft Teams — team helpers, office automation, workflow triggers  
- Twitter/X (where possible) — archival bots, quote-bots, data-fetch bots  
- Reddit — monitoring bots, subreddit triggers, data extraction  
- WhatsApp / Signal (via gateways) — alert bots, group helpers  
- YouTube / Twitch — live stream bots, chat moderators, reward bots  
- GitHub — automation bots (actions, dispatch), pulling data, issue management  
- IoT / MQTT / Smart home — physical-world bots, data collectors, trigger bots  
- Web API bots — using free APIs for weather, finance, fun tasks, sending results to chats  
- Email / RSS bots — monitor feeds, send summaries  
- Cloud functions / serverless bots — event-driven, zero-cost automation  

And more. The goal: pick a platform, build a useful bot, **use services that cost nothing (or as little as possible)**, and share it.

## 💡 My Cost-Free Maintenance Philosophy  
This project stands on a simple promise: **no budget, no paid hosting, no “mini subscription” trap.**  
Every service used is either:

- on a free-tier forever (no expiry)  
- or self-hostable on a free or extremely low-cost platform  
- or based only on free public APIs and open-source tools  

Here are some of the **API / service providers** (as of 2025-10-31) that offer truly free access, ideal for bots and automation:

- The “Public APIs” repository lists hundreds of free APIs you can use. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- MixedAnalytics provides a big list of free, open APIs with no auth required. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- FreeAPIs.dev and other community lists show hundreds more free services, ideal for bots and side projects. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

### Sample of Free API Categories & Providers  
Here are a few examples (each has its free layer or is freely accessible):

- Cat Facts, Dog Images, Random Joke APIs  
- Nationality/Gender/Name-Age Predictions (Agify.io, Genderize.io)  
- CSV/JSON data sets (Universities list, Zippopotam postal info)  
- Weather APIs (free tiers)  
- Public data 🇺🇸 (Data USA)  
- Astronomy & space data (NASA open APIs)  
- Topic-specific datasets (animals, environment, open government)  
- Many of these are listed via: “free public APIs” lists.  

This doesn’t mean **everything is entirely unlimited** — but the maintenance cost is zero (or extremely low) and there’s no recurring subscription required for typical usage in bots.

## 🧰 What’s Inside This Repo  
Here you’ll find folders such as:  
- `Lucky-Puppy-Bot/` (Telegram)  
- `Sigmund-Bot-Mastodon/`  
- (Future additions) more bots for Discord, Twitch, IoT, Webhooks, etc.

Each folder contains:  
- Source code (Python, Node.js, etc)  
- Deployment workflows (GitHub Actions, Fly.io config, etc)  
- Instructions/README inside each bot folder  
- **NB:** Credentials and API keys are *never committed*. Please check `.gitignore` for secret-file patterns.

## 🔮 What’s Coming Next  
In future updates I plan to:  
- Add a Discord community bot, a Twitch stream moderator bot, and a smart home integration bot  
- Provide a “bot platform checklist” that shows how I select services with zero cost  
- Share a list of self-hostable serverless frameworks (Free-Tier Functions)  
- Provide more public-API integrations (finance, games, environment)  
- Open-source “bot templates” for anyone to fork and use with free services  

I hope this grows into a **bot library** of sorts, where new bots can ride the “free-tier automation” wave and serve communities without cost.

## 🌟 A Giant Godly Thank You  
To **NemesisC64** — your pointers, tips, encouragement and iron-willed support have been nothing short of legendary.  
Thank you, NemesisC64 — this project wouldn’t have started without your guidance.  
May the bots serve well, the code shine clean, and the automations flow forever.

⚡️ Let’s build free-powered bots together.  
Happy coding and Godspeed!
