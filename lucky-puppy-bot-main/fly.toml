# IMPORTANT:
# - There is NO [[services]] block here because we're a worker (no HTTP).
# - If you later switch to Telegram webhooks, we'll add [[services]] and a /health route.

# OPTIONAL (add later only AFTER creating a volume):
# [mounts]
#   source = "data"
#   destination = "/data"
#
# You'll first need to create it with:
# flyctl volumes create data --app lucky-puppy-bot --region syd --size 1
